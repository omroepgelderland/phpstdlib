 * This is not possible if strict typing

 * @param resource|null $context A valid context resource created with

 * custom context, you can skip this parameter by NULL.
 * @param $offset The offset where the reading starts on the original stream.
 * Negative offsets count from the end of the stream.
 *
 * Seeking (offset) is not supported with remote files.
 * Attempting to seek on non-local files may work with small offsets, but this
 * is unpredictable because it works on the buffered stream.

/**
 * fopen binds a named resource, specified by
 * filename, to a stream.
 *
 * @param string $filename If filename is of the form "scheme://...", it
 * is assumed to be a URL and PHP will search for a protocol handler
 * (also known as a wrapper) for that scheme. If no wrappers for that
 * protocol are registered, PHP will emit a notice to help you track
 * potential problems in your script and then continue as though
 * filename specifies a regular file.
 *
 * If PHP has decided that filename specifies
 * a local file, then it will try to open a stream on that file.
 * The file must be accessible to PHP, so you need to ensure that
 * the file access permissions allow this access.
 * If you have enabled
 * open_basedir further
 * restrictions may apply.
 *
 * If PHP has decided that filename specifies
 * a registered protocol, and that protocol is registered as a
 * network URL, PHP will check to make sure that
 * allow_url_fopen is
 * enabled. If it is switched off, PHP will emit a warning and
 * the fopen call will fail.
 *
 * The list of supported protocols can be found in . Some protocols (also referred to as
 * wrappers) support context
 * and/or php.ini options. Refer to the specific page for the
 * protocol in use for a list of options which can be set. (e.g.
 * php.ini value user_agent used by the
 * http wrapper).
 *
 * On the Windows platform, be careful to escape any backslashes
 * used in the path to the file, or use forward slashes.
 *
 * @param 'r'|'r+'|'w'|'w+'|'a'|'a+'|'x'|'x+'|'c'|'c+'|'e' $mode The mode
 * parameter specifies the type of access you require to the stream.
 * It may be any of the following:
 *
 * A list of possible modes for fopen
 * using mode
 *
 * mode
 * Description
 *
 * 'r'
 *
 * Open for reading only; place the file pointer at the
 * beginning of the file.
 *
 * 'r+'
 *
 * Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at
 * the beginning of the file.
 *
 * 'w'
 *
 * Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the
 * beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length.
 * If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
 *
 * 'w+'
 *
 * Open for reading and writing; otherwise it has the
 * same behavior as 'w'.
 *
 * 'a'
 *
 * Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the end of
 * the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
 * In this mode, fseek has no effect, writes are always appended.
 *
 * 'a+'
 *
 * Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at
 * the end of the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to
 * create it. In this mode, fseek only affects
 * the reading position, writes are always appended.
 *
 * 'x'
 *
 * Create and open for writing only; place the file pointer at the
 * beginning of the file.  If the file already exists, the
 * fopen call will fail by returning FALSE and
 * generating an error of level E_WARNING.  If
 * the file does not exist, attempt to create it.  This is equivalent
 * to specifying O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags for the
 * underlying open(2) system call.
 *
 * 'x+'
 *
 * Create and open for reading and writing; otherwise it has the
 * same behavior as 'x'.
 *
 * 'c'
 *
 * Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, it is
 * created. If it exists, it is neither truncated (as opposed to
 * 'w'), nor the call to this function fails (as is
 * the case with 'x'). The file pointer is
 * positioned on the beginning of the file. This may be useful if it's
 * desired to get an advisory lock (see flock)
 * before attempting to modify the file, as using
 * 'w' could truncate the file before the lock
 * was obtained (if truncation is desired,
 * ftruncate can be used after the lock is
 * requested).
 *
 * 'c+'
 *
 * Open the file for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same
 * behavior as 'c'.
 *
 * 'e'
 *
 * Set close-on-exec flag on the opened file descriptor. Only
 * available in PHP compiled on POSIX.1-2008 conform systems.
 *
 * Different operating system families have different line-ending
 * conventions.  When you write a text file and want to insert a line
 * break, you need to use the correct line-ending character(s) for your
 * operating system.  Unix based systems use \n as the
 * line ending character, Windows based systems use \r\n
 * as the line ending characters and Macintosh based systems (Mac OS Classic) used
 * \r as the line ending character.
 *
 * If you use the wrong line ending characters when writing your files, you
 * might find that other applications that open those files will "look
 * funny".
 *
 * Windows offers a text-mode translation flag ('t')
 * which will transparently translate \n to
 * \r\n when working with the file.  In contrast, you
 * can also use 'b' to force binary mode, which will not
 * translate your data.  To use these flags, specify either
 * 'b' or 't' as the last character
 * of the mode parameter.
 *
 * The default translation mode is 'b'.
 * You can use the 't'
 * mode if you are working with plain-text files and you use
 * \n to delimit your line endings in your script, but
 * expect your files to be readable with applications such as old versions of notepad.  You
 * should use the 'b' in all other cases.
 *
 * If you specify the 't' flag when working with binary files, you
 * may experience strange problems with your data, including broken image
 * files and strange problems with \r\n characters.
 *
 * For portability, it is also strongly recommended that
 * you re-write code that uses or relies upon the 't'
 * mode so that it uses the correct line endings and
 * 'b' mode instead.
 * @param bool $use_include_path The optional third use_include_path parameter
 * can be set to TRUE if you want to search for the file in the
 * include_path, too.
 * @param resource|null $context A context stream
 * resource.
 * @return resource Returns a file pointer resource on success
 * @throws FilesystemException
