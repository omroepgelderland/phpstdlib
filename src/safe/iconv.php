 * Converts string from from_encoding

 *
 * @param $from_encoding The current encoding used to interpret string.
 * @param $to_encoding The desired encoding of the result.
 *
 * If the string //TRANSLIT is appended to
 * to_encoding, then transliteration is activated. This
 * means that when a character can't be represented in the target charset,
 * it may be approximated through one or several similarly looking
 * characters. If the string //IGNORE is appended,
 * characters that cannot be represented in the target charset are silently
 * discarded. Otherwise, E_NOTICE is generated and the function
 * will return FALSE.
 *
 * If and how //TRANSLIT works exactly depends on the
 * system's iconv() implementation (cf. ICONV_IMPL).
 * Some implementations are known to ignore //TRANSLIT,
 * so the conversion is likely to fail for characters which are illegal for
 * the to_encoding.
 * @param $string The string to be converted.
 * @return string Returns the converted string.
 * @throws IconvException
